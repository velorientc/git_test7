The serve tool is a wrapper for Mercurial's built-in web server. Once
launched, any computer can attach to the http port and browse your
repository(ies) or perform clone, pull, or even push operations (if you
configure your server to allow it).

Toolbar buttons:

	:guilabel:`Start`
		start the web server
	:guilabel:`Stop`
		stop the web server
	:guilabel:`Browse`
		open your default browser at the built-in web server
	:guilabel:`Configure`
		Configure repository web style, description, and access policies

When the settings dialog is launched via the :guilabel:`Configure`
button, it is run in the context of the current repository.  Please
visit the Mercurial wiki for detailed descriptions of the various
web configurations.

Multiple Repositories
---------------------

If you wish to serve a many repositories with a single web server
instance, you can create an :file:`hgwebdir.conf` text file with the
following contents: ::

	[paths]
	/ = /path/to/repositories/*

The first path '/' is where the repositories will appear in the context
of the web server and the second path describes here the repositories
can be found on your computer.  Multiple entries are possible.

To use this file you must launch the TortoiseHg serve dialog from the
command line via: :command:`hgtk serve --webdir-conf=hgwebdir.conf`.


From command line
-----------------

The server tool can be started from command line ::

	hgtk serve [OPTION]...

	web server

	options:

		--webdir-conf  name of the webdir config file

	use "hgtk -v help serve" to show global options

.. vim: noet ts=4
