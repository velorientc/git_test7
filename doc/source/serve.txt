.. module:: serve.dialog
   :synopsis: Dialog used to start/stop the web server

The serve tool is a wrapper for Mercurial's built-in web server. Once
launched, any computer can attach to the http port and browse your
repository(ies) or perform clone, pull, or even push operations (if you
configure your server to allow it).

   :alt: Web server dialog

:guilabel:`Start`
	start the web server

:guilabel:`Stop`
	stop the web server

:guilabel:`Browse`
	open your default browser at the built-in web server

:guilabel:`Configure`
	Configure repository web style, description, and access policies

When the settings dialog is launched via the :guilabel:`Configure` button, it is
run in the context of the current repository.  Please visit the
Mercurial wiki for detailed descriptions of what the various web
configurations are for.

If you wish to serve a many repositories with a single web server
instance, you can create an :file:`hgwebdir.conf` text file with the
following contents: ::

	[paths]
	/ = /path/to/repositories/*

The first path '/' is where the repositories will appear in the context
of the web server and the second path describes here the repositories
can be found on your computer.  Multiple entries are possible.

To use this file you must launch the TortoiseHg serve dialog from the
command line via: :command:`hgtk serve --webdir-conf=hgwebdir.conf`.  In a
future release of TortoiseHg, we hope to make this launchable from the
shell context menu.
