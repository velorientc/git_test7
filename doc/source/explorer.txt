Windows Explorer Integration
============================

Overlay Icons
-------------

TortoiseHg provides visual representation of the file status via overlay
icons in the MS-Explorer windows. This is similar to those that found on
other Tortoise client, such as TortoiseCVS and TortoiseSVN.

TortoiseHg shares the overlay icons with TortoiseSVN (version 1.5.x or
later) and the other "Tortoise" projects via the use of TortoiseOverlays
(another project created by TortoiseSVN team).

The context menu has an :guilabel:`Update Icons` option which forces
TortoiseHg to refresh the icons in the currently browsed repository or
directory of repositories. The taskbar icon will turn green and the
directory icons will turn into question marks while this refresh is in
progress.

The new C++ shell extension is an order of magnitude faster than the
Python extension used in previous releases, but we still make the
overlays configurable via the taskbar menu.  Simply click on the
Mercurial (droplet) icon in the system tray and select
:guilabel:`Options`.  In the options dialog you can disable overlays
globally, or enable them for local disks only.

Release 0.8.1 introduced the ability to selectively disable overlay
icons in specific repositories.  This can be done by editing the
:file:`.hg\\thgstatus` file inside the repository and replacing it's
contents with a single line containing::

	@@noicons

Context Menus
-------------

The TortoiseHg commands (GUI window & dialogs) may be accessed via the
context menu of Explorer windows. The TortoiseHg context menu is 
context sensitive and which varies according to the current folder and
file selection.  Here is the context menu for a revisioned folder:

And here is the context menu for selected files or folders:

TortoiseHg provides dialogs for the most regularly used Mercurial
commands.  Less frequently used and newly added Mercurial commands
must need be accessed on the CLI (command line interface) through 
:file:`cmd.exe` windows.

The context menus are configurable via the taskbar menu. Simply click on
the Mercurial (droplet) icon in the system tray and select
:guilabel:`Options`.  In the options dialog you can promote individual
menu options to the top menu.

Nautilus
--------

TortoiseHg also provides shell integration with the GNOME desktop via a
nautilus-python plugin.  If you have installed TortoiseHg from a
distribution package, the odds are that this extension is already
configured.  If not, please consult our Wiki for instructions on how to
enable this feature.

While the nautilus extension does not have it's own GUI for managing the
overlays and context menus, it does support command promotion into the
top menu.  It requires you to edit your :file:`~/.hgrc` file and add
lines like these::

	[tortoisehg]
	promoteditems = commit, log, synch
