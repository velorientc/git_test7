Windows Explorer Integration
============================

.. module:: explorer
	:synopsis: Windows explorer integration

Context Menus
-------------

TortoiseHg commands may be accessed via the context menu of Explorer
windows and other applications which use the standard File/Open dialogs.
Here is the context menu for a revisioned folder:

	Context menu for a folder under Mercurial revision control

And here is the context menu for selected files or folders:

TortoiseHg provides dialogs for the most regularly used Mercurial
commands.  Less frequently used and newly added Mercurial commands
may be accessed from the CLI (command line interface) through
:file:`cmd.exe` on Windows.

Overlay Icons
-------------

TortoiseHg provides visual representation of the file status via overlay
icons in the MS-Explorer windows. This is similar to those that found on
other Tortoise client, such as TortoiseCVS and TortoiseSVN.

TortoiseHg shares the overlay icons with TortoiseSVN (version 1.5.x or
later) and the other "Tortoise" projects via the use of TortoiseOverlays
(another project created by TortoiseSVN team).

The context menu has an :guilabel:`Update Icons` option which forces
TortoiseHg to refresh the icons in the currently browsed repository or
directory of repositories. The taskbar icon will turn green and the
directory icons will turn into question marks while this refresh is in
progress.

Shell Configuration
-------------------

The overlay handler and context menus are configurable.  From any folder
background (even the desktop), right click and select
:menuselection:`TortoiseHg --> Explorer Extension Settings`. This opens the
TortoiseHg Shell Configuration dialog.

On the tab "Context Menu" you can promote individual menu options to the
top level menu.

On the "Icons" tab you configure settings related to the overlay icons and the
icon of the "Overlay Icons Server" in the taskbar (in the notification area of
Windows).

:guilabel:`Enable overlays:`
	If checked, overlay icons are shown on folders and files in the
	working directory (woking copy) of Mercurial repositories.
	(Default: checked)

:guilabel:`Local disks only:`
	If checked, overlay icons are only shown for volumes on local disks, not
	on network shares. Scanning for Mercurial repositories over the network
	may result in high latency in the user interface of explorer. Check this
	option if browsing network shares becomes too slow and/or you do not need
	overlay icons on non-local volumes.
	(Default: not checked)

:guilabel:`Enabled Overlay Handlers:`
	These settings allow to enable/disable of overlay handlers in the
	shared TortoiseOverlays component. The TortoiseOverlays component is shared
	by all Tortoises (TortoiseHg, TortoiseSVN, etc), so that Windows overlay
	icon slots can be shared. The total number of overlay slots available on
	Windows is fairly limited and depends on the exact Windows version used
	and on what other programs are installed. For example, on a pristine install
	of Windows 7, there are only 8 free overlay handler slots available.
	This section allows to individually disable certain non-essential overlay
	handlers, so that they do not use up an overlay handler slot.
	Note that these settings affect ALL Tortoises per user (login).
	Unchecking handlers that are not used by TortoiseHg (that is: Locked,
	Readonly, Ignored, Deleted) is highly recommended, if you know that no
	other Tortoises (e.g. TortoiseSVN) are installed. Make sure the "Added"
	and "Unversioned" handlers are enabled (these are used by TortoiseHg).
	(Default: all checked)

:guilabel:`Taskbar:`
	Checkmark "Show Icon" to show the icon of the Overlay Icon Server in the
	taskbar in the notification area. "Highlight Icon" highlights that icon
	using a light green color while the icon server is busy updating cache files
	in the repository (files :file:`.hg\\dirstate` and :file:`.hg\\thgstatus`).
	(Default: both checked)

One can selectively disable overlay icons in a specific repository by
editing the :file:`.hg\\thgstatus` file inside the repository and
replacing it's contents with a single line containing::

	@@noicons

Nautilus
--------

TortoiseHg also provides shell integration with the GNOME desktop via a
nautilus-python plugin.  If you have installed TortoiseHg from a
distribution package, the odds are that this extension is already
configured.  If not, please consult our Wiki for instructions on how to
enable this feature.

While the nautilus extension does not have it's own GUI for managing the
overlays and context menus, it does support command promotion into the
top menu.  It requires you to edit your :file:`~/.hgrc` file and add
lines like these::

	[tortoisehg]
	promoteditems = commit, log, synch
