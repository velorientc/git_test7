Create a new repository
=======================

.. module:: init.dialog
	:synopsis: Dialog used to create a repository

To create a new repository into an existing directory (project) you
have to run the init dialog. From the explorer context menu select
:menuselection:`TortoiseHg... --> Create Repository Here` over the directory, or, within
the folder, type :command:`hgtk init`.

	Repository Init Dialog

:guilabel:`Destination`
	Is the directory where the repository will be created. It is
	always filled with the current directory, so if you launch the
	dialog from the right directory there is no reason to change it.
:guilabel:`Add special files (.hgignore, ...)`
	If selected TortoiseHg creates an empty :file:`.hgignore` file
	in the working directory.
:guilabel:`Make repo compatible with Mercurial 1.0`
	If selected TortoiseHg creates an old type Mercurial repository.
	Do not check unless you have a strong reason to do, and you know
	what you are doing.

Creating a new repository means create a subdirectory called :file:`.hg`.
In this subdirectory Mercurial keeps all versioning information.

.. warning::
	Never touch the files in :file:`.hg` directory, otherwise a repository
	corruption can happen.

From command line
-----------------

The init tool can be started from command line ::

	hgtk init

The syntax is ::

	hgtk init [DEST]

where [DEST] is the path to destination folder.

.. vim: noet ts=4
