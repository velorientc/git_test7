Create a new repository
=======================

.. module:: init.dialog
	:synopsis: Dialog used to create a repository

To create a new repository into an existing directory (project) you
have to run the init dialog. From the explorer context menu select
:menuselection:`TortoiseHg... --> Create Repository Here` over the directory, or, within
the folder, type :command:`thg init`.

	Repository Init Dialog

:guilabel:`Destination`
	Is the directory where the repository will be created. It is
	always filled with the current directory, so if you launch the
	dialog from the right directory there is no reason to change it.
:guilabel:`Add special files (.hgignore, ...)`
	If selected TortoiseHg creates an empty :file:`.hgignore` file
	in the working directory.
:guilabel:`Make repo compatible with Mercurial <1.7`
	If selected TortoiseHg creates an older format Mercurial repository.
	Do not check unless you have a strong reason to do, and you know
	what you are doing.
:guilabel:`Show in Workbench after init`
    When the repository was successfully created, it is added to the RepoRegistry,
    and opened in a new tab the Workbench.
:guilabel:`Hg command`
    This field displays the command that will be executed by the dialog.

Creating a new repository means create a subdirectory called :file:`.hg`.
In this subdirectory Mercurial keeps all its versioning information.

.. warning::
	It is dangerous to manually edit the files in :file:`.hg` directory,
	repository corruption can occur.  :file:`.hg/hgrc` is perhaps the
	only exception to this rule.

From command line
-----------------

The init tool can be started from command line ::

	thg init

The syntax is ::

	thg init [DEST]

where [DEST] is the path to destination folder.

.. vim: noet ts=4
