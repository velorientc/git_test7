Frequently Asked Questions
**************************


*What is TortoiseHg?*

	A Windows shell extension for the Mercurial revision control system,
	similar to the Tortoise clients for Subversion and CVS. It also
	includes an hgtk application for command line use on many platforms.

*What comes included in the TortoiseHg binary installer for Windows?*

	`Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/>`_,
	`kdiff3 <http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/>`_,
	`TortoisePlink <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/>`_
	five bonus extensions: hgfold, hgcr-gui, perfarce, hgeol, mercurial-keyring.
	python-svn for hgsubversion and convert extensions
	dulwich for hg-git use.
	See :file:`extension-versions.txt` in installer root for more details

*Is Mercurial on Windows compatible with the index service and virus scanners?*

	No. Like TortoiseSVN, `we recommend <http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2010-January/029680.html>`_
	to turn off the indexing service on the working copies and repositories,
	and exclude them from virus scans.

*How can I get translations for the Explorer context menu?*

	The available translations were stored by the installer under
	:file:`C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseHg\\i18n\\cmenu`.  Select the
	locale you would like to use, double-click on it, and confirm all
	requests.

*Can I configure the toolbars in TortoiseHg applications?*

	TortoiseHg dialogs are PyGtk applications, so they can be configured by
	modifying the gtkrc file that is installed as
	:file:`C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseHg\\gtk\\etc\\gtk-2.0\\gtkrc`::

		gtk-toolbar-icon-size = GTK_ICON_SIZE_LARGE_TOOLBAR
		# Pick an icon size from:
		# GTK_ICON_SIZE_MENU
		# GTK_ICON_SIZE_SMALL_TOOLBAR
		# GTK_ICON_SIZE_LARGE_TOOLBAR   (default)
		# GTK_ICON_SIZE_BUTTON
		# GTK_ICON_SIZE_DND
		# GTK_ICON_SIZE_DIALOG
		gtk-toolbar-style = GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH
		# Pick a toolbar style from:
		# GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS
		# GTK_TOOLBAR_TEXT
		# GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH              (default)
		# GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH_HORIZ

	These settings are applied globally to all TortoiseHg applications.

*How do I do merges and arbitrary version checkouts?*

	Merges and updates are intended to be done from within the Changelog
	tool (:guilabel:`Repository Explorer` menu option)

*How do I use TortoiseHg's shelve extension from the hg command line?*
	
	Enable the extension in your Mercurial.ini file::

		[extensions]
		tortoisehg.util.hgshelve=

*Why can't I connect to an ssh server (TortoisePlink.exe* ``...cannot execute specified...`` *error message)?*

	See `ssh <http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/wiki/ssh>`_.


*Why can't I connect to an ssh server (remote: bash: <server name>: command not found)?*

	TortoisePlink (and basic Plink) will try to use the :guilabel:`Host
	Name` configured in Putty under the :guilabel:`Default Settings`.
	It adds this host name to its command line parameters, causing the
	hostname to be specified twice, causing this particular error.
	Clearing the host name from the :guilabel:`Default Settings` is a
	possible workaround.

*How can I use tool X as my visual diff tool?*

	Since version 1.0, TortoiseHg should autodetect most popular visual
	diff tools and make them available for selection from the
	:guilabel:`Visual Diff Tool` item in the settings tool.

*I'm a CLI user, how do I disable the shell extension (overlay icons and context menus)?*

	Simply ask the installer to remove the shell extension entirely.

*How is TortoiseHg configured?*

	TortoiseHg gets configuration settings from two systems.

	1. The Mercurial configuration system, which is three-tiered
		1. Site-wide :file:`Mercurial.ini` in :file:`%ProgramFiles%\\TortoiseHg`
		2. Per-User :file:`Mercurial.ini` in :file:`%UserProfile%`
		3. Per-Repository :file:`Mercurial.ini` in :file:`{repo-root}\\.hg\\hgrc`
	2. :file:`%APPDATA%\\Tortoisehg` settings for application state
	   (window positions, etc)

	These are some of the configurables that are stored the Mercurial
	configuration system. ::
	
		[tortoisehg]
		vdiff = vdiff
		editor = gvim
		tabwidth = 4
		longsummary = True
		graphlimit = 500
		authorcolor = True
		authorcolor.steve = blue

*Is it possible to change fonts?*

	In some cases, yes. The gtools based dialogs (commit, status,
	shelve) allow some font configuration. ::

		[gtools]
		# font used in changeset viewer and commit log text
		fontcomment = courier 10
		# font used for diffs in status and commit tools
		fontdiff = courier 10
		# font used in file lists in status and commit tools
		fontlist = courier 9
		# font used in command output window
		fontlog = courier 10

*How do I switch GTK themes?*

	You also should be able to download new themes and copy them into
	the :file:`gtk\\share\\themes` directory and then enable them in
	:file:`gtk\\etc\\gtk-2.0\\gtkrc`.

*Where do TortoiseHg extensions look for external Python modules on Windows?*

	TortoiseHg includes an entire Python distribution bundled up as
	DLLs. The standard library modules are all in the
	:file:`library.zip` file in :file:`C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseHg`.

	If you try to use an extension that imports a non-standard Python
	module, you will find that the extension will fail to load because
	it can't find the module. For example the ReviewBoard extension
	imports the simplejson module, which is not part of the standard
	Python distribution.

	In order to make it work you need to add a couple of lines to the
	top of the extension's .py file, before the line that imports the
	foreign module::

		import sys
		sys.path.append(r'C:\path\to\module')

	Note that this will not work for modules distributed as .egg files;
	the supplied path must contain the module's .py or .pyc files.

	If you have many extensions and/or hooks that all share the same
	Python package, you can create an extension which explicitly
	modifies sys.path for all the others.  Simply name the extension
	such that it is loaded first (alphabetically).  Something like::

		[extensions]
		00setSysPath = C:\path\to\setsyspath.py

*How do I fix odd characters in dialog?*

	Since 0.8, we no longer distribute multiple themes and switched
	default theme to MS-Windows.  As a result, it might causes an issue
	related default font of MS-Windows theme in some environments.  In
	order to fix this issue, add following setting to TortoiseHg's
	:file:`gtkrc` file::

		style "msw-default"
		{
		font_name = "MS UI Gothic 9"
		}

	You can find :file:`gtkrc` file in your TortoiseHg install directory:
	i.e. :file:`C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseHg\\gtk\\etc\\gtk-2.0\\gtkrc`

.. vim: noet ts=4
