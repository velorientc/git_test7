	Rename Guessing Dialog

This dialog is used to find renames, moves, and/or copies that were done
without Mercurial's knowledge.  The dialog can be launched from the
shell context menu, or from the status or commit tools via the context
menu of an unknown file.

Follow these steps:

1) select one or more of the :guilabel:`Unrevisioned Files`
2) slide the simularity bar to the percentage match you desire
3) press either :guilabel:`Find Renames` or :guilabel:`Find Copies`.
4) select candidate matches and accept good matches
5) repeat until all unrevisioned files are matched

Find Renames
------------

This feature will search the repository for missing files (files which
were revisioned but are now gone).  For each missing file, it compares
the last revisioned data against the unrevisioned file and if the
percentage of matching lines is above the
:guilabel:`Minimum Simularity Percentage`, it adds the pair to the
:guilabel:`Candidate Matches`.

Find Copies
-----------

This feature will check every revisioned file in the repository to see
if it exactly matches the unrevisioned file.

Candidate Matches
-----------------

When you select a match in this list, the differences between the two
files are shown in the bottom pane.  Pressing :guilabel:`Accept Match`
will record the rename or copy event with Mercurial.

From command line
-----------------

The guess tool can be started from command line::

	hgtk guess

	guess previous renames or copies

	use "hgtk -v help guess" to show global options

.. vim: noet ts=4
