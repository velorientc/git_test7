.. module:: changelog.dialog
	:synopsis: Dialog used to view log

The changelog tool (*also known as the repository explorer*) is
used to visualize the revision history of your repository and to perform
any maintenence tasks that involve changesets. It presents a graph of
the revision history, showing the parent/child relationship of each
change. At each revision you can view the files that were modified and
the contents of those changes.

	:alt: Changelog

	Changelog viewer dialog with main toolbar hidden

New in 0.9, the changelog tool has a menu bar for accessing tool
functions and for launching other tools.

	:guilabel:`Tools`
		Launch other TortoiseHg tools as separate processes
	:guilabel:`View`
		Toggle the visibility of various features, or refresh views
	:guilabel:`Navigate`
		Select specific changesets in your repository history
	:guilabel:`Synchronize`
		Access synchronization functions, more below
	:guilabel:`Help`
		Help contents shows this web page.  About shows TortoiseHg
		version info

The toolbar buttons from left to right:

	:guilabel:`Refresh`
		Reload the revision history (if you commit in another window, etc)
	:guilabel:`Synchronize`
		Opens synchronize tool to communicate changes with other repositories
	:guilabel:`Patch Queue`
		Toggles the display of the MQ pane.  This button is only visible
		when the MQ extension has been enabled by the user.
	:guilabel:`Load more`
		load the next N revisions into the graph
	:guilabel:`Load all`
		load all remaining revisions into the graph

Sync Bar

	Synchronization features in changelog tool

From left to right...

	:guilabel:`Incoming`
		Download incoming changesets from the remote repository, store
		them in a temporary bundle file, then enter bundle preview mode
		with the incoming changes applied.  Incoming changesets will
		have a 'down' arrow in the revision graph.
	:guilabel:`Accept`
		Accept (pull) the changesets from the previewed bundle.  This
		button is only sensitive when previewing a changeset bundle.
		The after-pull effect is respected after pulling from a bundle.
	:guilabel:`Reject`
		Reject the changesets from the previewed bundle and exit preview
		mode.  This button is only sensitive when previewing a changeset
		bundle.
	:guilabel:`Pull`
		Pull incoming changesets from the remote repository, then apply
		after-pull effect (update, fetch, or rebase).
	:guilabel:`Outgoing`
		Determine outgoing changesets that would be pushed to the
		remote repository.  Outgoing changesets are marked with an 'up'
		arrow.
	:guilabel:`Push`
		Push outgoing changesets to the remote repository.
	:guilabel:`Email`
		Email outgoing changesets to the remote repository.
	:guilabel:`Stop`
		Stop current transaction.  The button is only sensitive during
		outgoing commands.

To the right of the :guilabel:`Stop` button is a combo box containing
all of the configured peer repository paths for the current repository.
The default path is selected at startup, if it has been configured.
See `hg.1.html#urls <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#urls>`_  for
details on specifying remote repository URLs.

To the right of the path combo box is the :guilabel:`After Pull` combo
that selects the operation which is performed after every pull operation
triggered by the sync bar.  The user must have the rebase extension
enabled in order for that option to be available in the after pull
combo.  The same is true of the fetch extension and it's post pull
operation.

To the right of the :guilabel:`After Pull` combo is the
:guilabel:`Settings` button.  It opens the repository settings tool on
the :guilabel:`Sync` tab where the after pull configurable and peer
repository paths can be configured.

Changesets which are added to the repository after the changelog tool
was opened are marked with green stars in the graph.  This includes
recent commits, pulled changesets, and applied patches.

.. note::
	To clear the new, incoming, and outgoing marks from the changeset
	graph, use :guilabel:`View -> Reset Marks`

Search Bar

	Filter features in changelog tool

The search bar allows one to quickly filter the changesets panel.
Buttons from right to left...

	:guilabel:`All`
		Show all changesets in the respository.  Essentially removes all
		filters.
	:guilabel:`Tagged`
		Show only changesets with tags.
	:guilabel:`Ancestry`
		Show only changesets that are ancestors of the currently
		selected changeset.  This option is only sensitive when a
		revision is selected.
	:guilabel:`Parents`
		Show only the working directory parent revisions.  Unless a
		merge is in progress, this will be only one revision.
	:guilabel:`Heads`
		Show only repository heads (changesets without any child
		revisions).
	:guilabel:`Merges`
		Show only merge changesets (changesets with two parents)
	:guilabel:`Hide Merges`
		A toggle button, not a radio like the other buttons in the
		search bar, which toggles the display of merge changesets.
	:guilabel:`Branches`
		A combo box with the list of named branches in your repository.
		See :guilabel:`Repo Settings -> Changelog -> Dead Branches` for
		a method to prune names from this combo box.
	:guilabel:`Custom Filter Combo`
		Finally there is a combo box that selects among the various
		filter types that can be manually specified.

To specify a custom filter, the user selects the filter type, enters
the search text of that type, and then hits return in the text entry.

	:guilabel:`Rev Range`
		Parse the user text as a revision range.  See
		`hg.1.html#revisions <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#revisions>`_ 
		for details on how to specify revision ranges.
	:guilabel:`File Patterns`
		Parse the user text as a file pattern glob, unless the user text
		is prefixed with a pattern type like *regexp:*.  See
		`hg.1.html#patterns <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#patterns>`_ 
		for details on how to specify file patterns.
	:guilabel:`Keywords`
		Parse the user text as a keyword pattern that should be matched
		against changeset meta data like comitter, message, etc.
	:guilabel:`Date`
		Parse the user text as a date range.  See

		for details on how to specify date ranges.
	:guilabel:`User`
		Parse the user text as a user / comitter name.


Revision Graph Details
----------------------

The graph column shows the child-parent relationships between revisions
in your repository history.  This column auto-sizes for as many lines of
ancestry that are required to visualize the revisions you have loaded.
The column has an initial hard-limit width to prevent some degenerative
cases from breaking the viewer, but can be resized after refreshes.

.. [#flcm3] The new contents will appear as local changes and must be committed.


Changeset browser
-----------------

The changeset browser will only show a single file's diffs at a time, as
a performance optimization.  If you would like to see all of the file
diffs at once, click on the :guilabel:`[All Files]` row.  The changeset
browser will also skip displaying diffs for files which are above a
maximum limit. See
:menuselection:`Global Settings --> TortoiseHg --> Max Diff Size`.  The
size limit can be temporarily disabled by toggling :menuselection:`View
-> Ignore Max Diff Size`.

The changelog and datamine tools can open the changeset browser to view
a single revision or the combined effect of a range of revisions. The
changeset browser is very similar to the commit and shelve tools. It has
a file list on the left of all files that have been changed, and a diff
pane on the right with the changes to each file.

The diff pane is tabbed and allows one to select files and hunks that
you wish to extract from the changeset(s) you are browsing and write
them to a patch file using the :guilabel:`Save as` toolbar button.  This
is a very efficient way to cherry pick changes from a repository.  This
changeset browser also supports the :kbd:`Ctrl-C` keyboard accelerator
to copy hightlighted diff hunks to the clipboard.

Unfortunately, TortoiseHg still does not have a dialog for importing
patches into a repository, so this must be done on the command line with
the :command:`hg import` command.

Keyboard navigation
-------------------

:kbd:`Ctrl-P`
	Zoom to the working directory parent revision
:kbd:`Ctrl-D`
	Display visual diffs for selected changeset or file
:kbd:`Ctrl-R`
	Refresh repository contents


Configurables
-------------

The changelog browser has a few configurable options that can be set in
the TortoiseHg Settings dialog on the Changelog tab.

	:guilabel:`Author coloring`
		If true, each author's changeset will be given a unique color
	:guilabel:`Long Summary`
		Concatenate commit message lines until 80 chars are reached
	:guilabel:`Graph batch limit`
		Number of revisions to read in each batch load
	:guilabel:`Copy Hash`
		Copy a revision's changeset id hash to the clipboard when selected
		[DEPRECATED]
	:guilabel:`Dead Branches`
		Comma separated list of branch names that should be ignored
		when building a list of branch names for a repository.
	:guilabel:`Branch Colors`
		Space separated list of branch names and colors on the
		form branch:#XXXXXX. Spaces and colons in the branch name must be
		escaped using a backslash (\\). Likewise some other characters
		can be escaped in this way, e.g. \\u0040 will be decoded to the
		@ character, and \\n to a linefeed.
	:guilabel:`Hide Tags`
		Space separated list of tags that will not be shown.  Useful
		example: Specify "qbase qparent qtip" to hide the standard tags
		inserted by the Mercurial Queues Extension.
	:guilabel:`Use Expander`
		Show changeset details within an expander.  When contained
		within the expander, the details do not scroll with the
		changeset contents.

The exact colors given to particular users can be configured by adding
lines like these to your :file:`Mercurial.ini` file: ::

	[tortoisehg]
	authorcolor.USERNAME = color

The changelog browser also respects the following settings on the
TortoiseHg tab:

	:guilabel:`Tab Width`
		Number of spaces to expand tabs in diffs
	:guilabel:`Max Diff Size`
		Maximum size of file to be diffed
	:guilabel:`Bottom Diffs`
		Show diffs below file list


From command line
-----------------

The changelog viewer can be started from command line ::

	hgtk log [OPTIONS] [FILE]

	aliases: history

	changelog viewer

	options:

	 -l --limit  limit number of changes displayed

	use "hgtk -v help log" to show global options
