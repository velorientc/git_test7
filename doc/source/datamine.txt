===================
TortoiseHg Datamine
===================

This page describes the 0.7 version of datamine

The datamine application is used to inspect the revision history of your
repository.  It is a tabbed application that supports two tab types,
shown below.  


Search Tabs

   Search dialog

The search tab is used to search (*grep*) through your entire revision
history for keywords, variable names, functions, etc... 

The text entry fields have these purposes:

*regexp*
	this is where you enter your regular expression search criteria.
*includes*
	a comma separated list of paths to include in your search. If no
	paths are given, the search is assumed to be repository wide. In
	other words, specifying an include path actually narrows the search
 	criteria.
*excludes*
	a comma separated list of paths to exclude from your search.
	Exclusion patterns are applied after inclusion patterns.
	
The toggle buttons below the entry fields are for:

*Follow copies and renames*
	follow searches through copies and renames out of inclusion filters
*Ignore case*
	Perform the search without case considerations
*Show line numbers*
	Show line numbers at the front of the matching lines
*Show all matching revisions*
	Show every instance where the search criteria matches in a file, not
	just the most recent revision.  It shows +/- to indicate whether the
	change adds or removes your search text.
		
		
Search tabs are named after the search string most recently used to
start a search.  The *New Search* toolbar button will obviously open a
new search tab while the *Stop* button will terminate an ongoing search
(the *Stop* button is only sensitive when a search is in progress).
		
Matches
-------

Each match will be a link to a changeset and will have a descriptive
tooltip (author, date/time, summary).  Right clicking on a matched line
will bring up a context menu with these features:

*display change*
	open a changeset window with this changeset, to see the full context
*annotate file*
	open an annotation tab for this file at this revision
*file history*
	open a changelog window with this file's revision history
		
Annotate Tabs
-------------

   Annotate tabs


The revision graph has a simple context menu for opening the entire
changeset in the changeset browser. Activating a row in the revision
graph updates the file annotation to that revision.

In the bottom pane is the actual annotation. Each line in the annotation
is also a link to the changeset which provided that line. Activating a
row will open that changeset in the changeset browser.

The color scheme in the annotation pane is two tier. Authors are
determined by hue, and age is determined by saturation. The older a
change is, the lighter the color becomes.

By right-clicking on the annotate pane's column headers (Line, Rev,
Source) you can bring up a menu for showing two optional columns:
*filename* and *user*.

Configurables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The annotate tabs support the following configurations defined primarily
for other tools:
				
*Changelog->Author Coloring*
	Give each author a separate color in the changelog graph
*TortoiseHg->Tab width*
	Number of spaces to expand tabs in diffs and annotate output
