Ignore Filter
=============

.. module:: ignore.dialog
	:synopsis: Dialog used to maintain the ignore filter

The ignore dialog is used to maintain your Mercurial repository's ignore
filter, which can be found in an :file:`.hgignore` file in the
repository root.  The dialog can be launched from the shell context
menu, or from the status or commit tools via the context menu of an
unknown file.  The :guilabel:`Glob` combo allows to switch between glob
or regexp patterns.
