===================

This page describes the 0.7 version of recovery, though very little was
changed in 0.8

The buttons all equate to a single Mercurial command (save stop, obviously)

*clean*
    ``hg update --clean`` - performs a clean checkout of the existing
    working directory parent revision.  Undoes a partially completed
    merge.

*rollback*
    ``hg rollback`` - undo operation for most recent repository
    transaction.  Can undo a commit or pull.

*recover*
    ``hg recover`` - recover from a badly aborted operation.  Rarely
    necessary, Mercurial will tell you if it needs to be performed.

*verify*
    ``hg verify`` - perform a consistency check of the contents of your
    repository
