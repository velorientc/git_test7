The buttons all equate to a single Mercurial command (save stop, obviously)

:guilabel:`clean`
	:command:`hg update --clean` - performs a clean checkout of the existing
	working directory parent revision.  Undoes a partially completed
	merge.

:guilabel:`rollback`
	:command:`hg rollback` - undo operation for most recent repository
	transaction.  Can undo a commit or pull.

:guilabel:`recover`
	:command:`hg recover` - recover from a badly aborted operation.  Rarely
	necessary, Mercurial will tell you if it needs to be performed.

:guilabel:`verify`
	:command:`hg verify` - perform a consistency check of the contents of your
	repository

.. vim: noet ts=4
