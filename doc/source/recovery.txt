	Recovery Dialog

The toolbar buttons equate to a Mercurial command

:guilabel:`clean`
	:command:`hg update --clean` - performs a clean checkout of the
	current (first) working directory parent revision.  Undoes an
	aborted or partially completed merge.  This will destroy all
	changes, please use carefully.  You should shelve any changes you
	wish to keep before using this command.


:guilabel:`rollback`
	:command:`hg rollback` - undo operation for the most recent
	repository transaction, which is usually a commit or a pull.  There
	is no way to know for certain what operation will be rolled back, so
	only use this in situations where you know what the last transaction
	was.


:guilabel:`recover`
	:command:`hg recover` - recover from a badly aborted transaction.
	This is rarely necessary, and Mercurial will inform you if it ever
	needs to be performed.


:guilabel:`verify`
	:command:`hg verify` - perform a consistency check of the contents of your
	repository.  Completely safe.
