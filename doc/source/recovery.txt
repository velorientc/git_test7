TortoiseHg Recovery

.. module:: recovery.dialog
   :synopsis: Dialog used to perform recovery operations

This page describes the 0.7 version of recovery, though very little was
changed in 0.8

The buttons all equate to a single Mercurial command (save stop, obviously)

:guilabel:`clean`
    :command:`hg update --clean` - performs a clean checkout of the existing
    working directory parent revision.  Undoes a partially completed
    merge.

:guilabel:`rollback`
    :command:`hg rollback` - undo operation for most recent repository
    transaction.  Can undo a commit or pull.

:guilabel:`recover`
    :command:`hg recover` - recover from a badly aborted operation.  Rarely
    necessary, Mercurial will tell you if it needs to be performed.

:guilabel:`verify`
    :command:`hg verify` - perform a consistency check of the contents of your
    repository
