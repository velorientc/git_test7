What is TortoiseHG?
===================
	
TortoiseHg is a set of graphical tools and a shell extension for the
`Mercurial <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial>`_ distributed revision control
system.

On Windows,
	TortoiseHg consists of a shell extension, which provides overlay
	icons and context menus in your file explorer, and a command line
	program named hgtk.exe which can launch the TortoiseHg tools.
	Binary packages of TortoiseHg for Windows come with Mercurial and a
	merge tool and are thus completely ready for use "Out of the Box".

On Linux,
	TortoiseHg consists of a command line hgtk script, and a Nautilus
	extension which provides overlays and context menus in your file
	explorer.

TortoiseHg is primarily written in Python and PyGtk (the Windows shell
extension being a noticeable exception).  The hgtk script can be used
on any platform that supports PyGtk, including Mac OS X.


Installing TortoiseHG
=====================

On Windows
----------

TortoiseHG comes with an easy to use installer. Double click on the installer
file and follow the instructions. The installer will take care of the rest.

After the installation a reboot is necessary.

.. note::
	If you have an old version (less than 0.8) already installed the installer
	stops and ask you to remove the previous version of TortoiseHG and
	TortoiseOverlays (this must be removed from control panel).
	
	If you have a 0.8 version, or later, already installed you have to exit
	from THGTaskBar before procede with the installation.
	

Language settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TortoiseHG user interface has been translated into many languages. You don't
need to download any language pack. All the available languages are shipped with
the installer. Look at :file:`C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseHG\\locale` for the
available languages. To enable a language just set the environment variable
``LANG`` to the desidered language, e.g. for italian ``SET LANG=it``.

.. note::
	If, after the language setting, the standard GUI element like :guilabel:`OK`,
	:guilabel:`Apply` etc. still appear in english, it means that TortoiseHGSetup
	doesn't ship the translated component of GTK+. This is probably due to a
	not completed translation of TortoiseHG at the moment of release it.
	
The shell extension (read explorer context menu) has a different approach. The
translated strings are read from the registry regardless the ``LANG``
environment variable.
Actually no registry setting files are shipped with TortoiseHG. You have to
download from http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/src/tip/win32/, once
the desidered file is downloaded just double click on it (rename in .reg
if the extension is .txt) and confirm all the requests. It takes effect at 
the next reboot.
