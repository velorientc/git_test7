   :synopsis: Introduce TortoiseHg and its various parts

TortoiseHg is a set of graphical tools and a shell extension for the
`Mercurial <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial>`_ distributed revision control
system.

On Windows,
    TortoiseHg consists of a shell extension, which provides overlay
    icons and context menus in your file explorer, and a command line
    program named hgtk.exe which can launch the TortoiseHg tools.
    Binary packages of TortoiseHg for Windows come with Mercurial and a
    merge tool and are thus completely ready for use "Out of the Box".

On Linux,
    TortoiseHg consists of a command line hgtk script, and a Nautilus
    extension which provides overlays and context menus in your file
    explorer.

TortoiseHg is primarily written in Python and PyGtk (the Windows shell
extension being a noticeable exception).  The hgtk script can be used
on any platform that supports PyGtk, including Mac OS X.
