	:synopsis: Introduce TortoiseHg and its various parts

What is TortoiseHg?
===================
	
TortoiseHg is a set of graphical tools and a shell extension for the
`Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/>`_ distributed revision control
system.

On Windows,
	TortoiseHg consists of a shell extension, which provides overlay
	icons and context menus in your file explorer, and a command line
	program named hgtk.exe which can launch the TortoiseHg tools.
	Binary packages of TortoiseHg for Windows come with Mercurial and a
	merge tool and are thus completely ready for use "Out of the Box".

On Linux,
	TortoiseHg consists of a command line hgtk script, and a Nautilus
	extension which provides overlays and context menus in your file
	explorer.

TortoiseHg is primarily written in Python and PyGtk (the Windows shell
extension being a noticeable exception).  The hgtk script and TortoiseHg
dialogs can be used on any platform that supports PyGtk, including Mac
OS X.


Installing TortoiseHg
=====================

On Windows
----------

TortoiseHg comes with an easy to use installer. Double click on the installer
file and follow the instructions. The installer will take care of the rest.

After installation a reboot is necessary.

.. note::
	If you have an older (less than 0.8) version already installed, the
	installer will ask that you to remove the previous version of
	TortoiseHg, which must be removed from control panel.  Removing
	TortoiseOverlays is also recommended, if no other apps are using
	them, but not strictly required.

	If you have 0.8 or later already installed, you must close all
	instances of the ThgTaskBar application before installation can
	procede.
	

Language settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TortoiseHg user interface has been translated into many languages.
You don't need to download a language pack. All the available languages
are shipped with the installer. Look in
:file:`C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseHg\\locale` for the available
languages. To enable a language just set the environment variable
``LANG`` to the desidered language, e.g. for italian ``SET LANG=it``.

.. note::
	After setting LANG, if the standard GUI elements like :guilabel:`OK`,
	:guilabel:`Apply` etc. still appear in English, it means that the
	TortoiseHg installer did not include the translation component of GTK+
	for your locale.  This was probably due to an incomplete translation
	of TortoiseHg at the moment of release it.

The Windows shell extension context menus get their translations from
the Windows registry.  Translations for many locales are available from
the TortoiseHg `wiki <http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/wiki/install>`_.
Once the desidered file is downloaded (rename it to :file:`.reg` if the
extension is :file:`.txt`), double-click on it and confirm all the requests.

On Linux and Mac
----------------

RPM packages for Fedora are available on the
`Download <http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/downloads/>`_
page of the wiki.

Deb packages for Ubuntu can be found at
`this <https://launchpad.net/~maxb/+archive/ppa>`_ or
`that <https://launchpad.net/~tortoisehg-ppa>`_ location.

For MacOSX, no packages are available but you can run hgtk and all the
dialogs via the source install method.
`MacOSX <http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/wiki/MacOSX>`_.

Language settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TortoiseHg tools use Python's
`gettext <http://docs.python.org/library/gettext.html>`_ library to
localize their text.  To get localized dialogs, it is recommended that
you set the LANGUAGE environment variable to your locale of choice.
