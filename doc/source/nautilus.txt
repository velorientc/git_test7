GNOME desktop integration
=========================

.. module:: nautilus
	:synopsis: GNOME desktop integration

TortoiseHg also provides shell integration with the GNOME desktop via a
nautilus-python plugin.  If you have installed TortoiseHg from a
distribution package, the odds are that this extension is already
configured.  If not, please consult our Wiki for instructions on how to
enable this feature.

While the nautilus extension does not have its own GUI for managing the
overlays and context menus, it does support command promotion into the
top menu.  It requires you to edit your :file:`~/.hgrc` file and add
lines like these::

	[tortoisehg]
	promoteditems = commit, log, synch

.. figure:: figures/nautilus.png
	:alt: Nautilus screenshot

	GNOME/Nautilus screenshot

.. vim: noet ts=4
