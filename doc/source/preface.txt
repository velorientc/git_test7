	:synopsis: About this manual

Audience
========

This book is written for computer literate folk who want to use
Mercurial to manage their data, but are uncomfortable using the command
line client to do so. Since TortoiseHg is a windows shell extension it's
assumed that the user is familiar with the windows explorer and knows
how to use it.

Reading guide
=============

This Preface explains a little about the TortoiseHg project, the
community of people who work on it, and the licensing conditions for
using it and distributing it.

The :doc:`intro`, explains what TortoiseHg is, what it does, where it
comes from and the basics for installing it on your PC.

The :doc:`quick`, is a quick tutorial on how to start with TortoiseHg.

The remaining chapters describe the tools that are part of TortoiseHg.

`GPLv2 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html>`_.  You are free to
