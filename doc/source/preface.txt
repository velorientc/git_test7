	:synopsis: About this manual

Audience
========

This book is written for computer literate folk who want to use
Mercurial to manage their data, but are uncomfortable using the command
line client to do so. Since TortoiseHg is a Windows shell extension it's
assumed that the user is familiar with the Windows explorer and knows
how to use it.

You can find the most up to date version of this documentation at our
`web <http://tortoisehg.org>`_ site.

Acknowledgements
================

Thanks to the many people who contribute to the TortoiseHg project.  It
takes a community of developers, translators, and users to build a
truly useful tool (especially users who care enough to report bugs and
file feature requests).

The TortoiseHg installer for Windows includes the TortoiseOverlays handler,
as provided by the `TortoiseSVN <http://tortoisesvn.net>`_ project.

The history viewer of TortoiseHg is based on 
`hgview <http://www.logilab.org/project/hgview>`_, a tool developed by
`David Douard <david.douard@logilab.fr>`_ and others, with the financial
support of `Logilab <http://www.logilab.fr>`_.
