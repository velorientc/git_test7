Start on a project
==================

There are many ways to start with Mercurial/TortoiseHg on a project.

1. The project already exists and is unrevisioned. You have to *create*
   a new repository.
2. You want to hack on a project already revisioned with Mercurial. You
   have to *clone* a repository.
3. The project already exists and is revisioned under a different
   SCM. You have to *convert* the repository.

.. note::
	Other cases, like *an existing project under a different SCM, you
	want to keep this SCM but use Mercurial as client*,	are out of the
	scope of this manual, and TortoiseHg can not help you in any way.
   
In the first two cases TortoiseHg can help you with a specific tool, see
the next two sections.

Convert a project
-----------------

TortoiseHg has not a specific tool to do the conversion, but after the
conversion done with Mercurial you can use TortoiseHg as usually in
this converted project.

How to do the conversion is not in the scope of this manual, please
refer to http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RepositoryConversion for
more details.

Normally a conversion is done by enabling the *convert* extension and,
from the parent directory of the checked-out project type::

	hg convert myproject
	
After the conversion you have a sibling directory of :file:`myproject`
called :file:`myproject-hg`. Start to play on it.

.. vim: noet ts=4
