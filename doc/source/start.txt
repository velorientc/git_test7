Start on a project
==================

.. module:: start
	:synopsis: Dialog used to create a repository

There are many ways to start with Mercurial/TortoiseHg on a project.

1. The project already exists and is unrevisioned. You have to *create*
   a new repository.
2. You want to hack on a project already revisioned with Mercurial. You
   have to *clone* a repository.
3. The project already exists and is revisioned under a different
   SCM. You have to *convert* the repository.

.. note::
	Other cases, like *an existing project under a different SCM, you
	want to keep this SCM but use Mercurial as client*,	are out of the
	scope of this manual, and TortoiseHg can not help you in any way.
   
In the first two cases TortoiseHg can help you with a specific tool, see
the next two sections.

Clone a repository

TODO

Convert a project
-----------------

How to perform the conversion is not in the scope of this manual, please
refer to http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RepositoryConversion for more
details.  Normally a conversion is done by enabling the *convert*
extension and, from the parent directory of the checked-out project
typing::

	hg convert myproject
	
After the conversion you have a sibling directory of :file:`myproject`
called :file:`myproject-hg`. Start to use it.

.. vim: noet ts=4
