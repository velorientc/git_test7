                    Release Notes for TortoiseHg

This file contains last minute notes to users about the releases, which may not
be included in the documentation or README files included with the distribution
kits.  It also contains change information, for users who are interested in
what bugs have been fixed, and what features have been added in the current
version.


New features in 0.2

  * Gtools has been integrated into TortoiseHg proper. It is no longer
    bundled as a Mercurial extension. The graphlog extension is now enabled
    again by default (only usable from the CLI, however).
      
  * Context menu icons, application window icons. The context menu has been
    simplified.
      
  * The changelog browser has a number of new features (filters and context
    menu options). The tag browser and changelog tagging features have been
    merged into this tool.
      
  * Hgview is now the default history viewer, hgk is being deprecated.
   
  * An email dialog for interfacing with the patchbomb extension. It can be
    reached from the synchronize dialog and from the changelog browser.
     
  * A new configuration tool (replacing hg-config dialogs) that allows you
    to configure TortoiseHg and Mercurial.
      
  * Most dialogs now use HgThread and GtkUI to run hg commands. These 
    classes run the command in a background thread and provide GUI prompts
    for when user interaction is necessary (http web auth, etc). For some 
    commands, it also provides a progress bar.
      
  * A preview of the new Mercurial merge back end. The python hgmerge.py 
    script is being integrated into Mercurial, and this installer has a
    preview of how that will work. You need to unset any ui.merge in your
    Mercurial.ini file in order for it to work properly. If you don't 
    configure anything it will use simplemerge to automatically perform 
    merges. If conflicts are found it falls back to kdiff3 to resolve 
    them interactively.
      
  * Slight improvement on speed of overlay icons display.
    
  * A new 'about' dialog.

Bugs fixed in 0.2

  * [SF Bug #1851395] Overlay icons and context menus are no longer 
    restricted to MS-Explorer. So other file managers, such as Total 
    Commander, should be supported.
      
  * [SF Bug #1844722] Users can now create repositories inside repository
     via the context menu.
