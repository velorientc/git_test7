== TortoiseHg 0.9 ==

Released November 16, 2009

Codenamed **Sandpaper**

=== Packaged Versions ===

TortoiseHg 0.9 requires Mercurial version 1.4

=== Behavior Changes ===

* dropped support for external commit tools
* potentially harmful extensions are no longer loaded for you.  MQ, qup,
rebase, transplant, and fetch must be enabled by the user to unlock their
support inside the TortoiseHg tools.
* The synchronize tool has been deprecated.  Most of it's functionality has
been merged into the changelog tool.  Synchronize will be removed in a future
release.
* commit tool - after a commit, all remaining files are unchecked
* commit/status/etc - context menus were refactored as per issue #133

**Note** During upgrade, it is possible for the taskbar app to crash when the
installer closes it.  This only happens if the taskbar config dialog has been
opened, and it only seems to happen on slower XP machines.  It is also
harmless.  The installer was trying to kill it, it just happened to die in a
non-orderly fashion.  Just ignore the crash.  If you don't want to see this
happen, simply exit the taskbar app before starting the upgrade.

=== Enhancements ===

* spell checker for commit and email tools (gtkspell, Gnome only)
* changelog - integrate synchronize functionality, including previews of incoming changesets

* commit - QNew and Qrefresh improvements, 'patch contents' tab
* commit - merge improvements
* archive - new archive feature, from both 'hgtk archive' and the changelog menu
* synch - shelve toolbar button
* thgtaskbar - added --noicon command line argument
* shelve - 'shelf contents' tab

=== Bug fixes ===

* changelog - clicking on cset links loads revisions if needed
* status - catch IOErrors during repo.status
* rename - fix error handling when no arguments specified
* too many more to enumerate

=== Installer / Source Changes ===

* Spell Checker depends on gtkspell.  In Debian 5 it is included in the package
python-gnome2-extras, in sid probably in python-gtkspell
* [[http://code.google.com/p/iniparse/|iniparse]] was unbundled from the source repository
* The hggtk and thgutil python packages were moved into tortoisehg/hgtk and tortoisehg/util, respectively



= 0.8 Release July 1, 2009 =

== C++ Shell Extension ==

The Python shell extension has been removed in favor of a pure C++ shell
extension which directly reads the Mercurial dirstate for overlays, and
produces hard-coded context menus.  This should fix much of the
interoperability problems reported in issue #67, and it fixes the
overlay performance problems we have suffered since version 0.1.

To support fast overlay icons, we have introduced a taskbar application
(thgtaskbar.exe, programmed in Python) that externalizes the refreshing
of cache information (new cache file ".hg/thgstatus") into a separate
server process (started on user logon), controlled by the shell
extension over a named pipe. thgtaskbar.exe adds a systray icon with an
options dialog to control settings affecting the shell extension.

== X64 Support ==

The C++ TortoiseHg shell extension works properly in x64 Vista and Win7
environments.  Release 0.8 does not support having 32bit and 64bit
extensions installed on the same machine.  We do plan to support this in
0.9.

== Translations ==

TortoiseHg 0.8 is the first release to include translations. This
release has translations for 13 locales.  Eight of those are full or
nearly full translations.

== Linux packages ==

RPM and DEB packages will be made available for download for this
release.

== MacOSX support ==

* hgtk works on MacOSX, but requires one to build GTK+
* Workarounds for multiple window map events
* Uses apple key for command sequences (%-W, %-Q, %-D)

== Behavior Changes ==

The Ctrl-O accelerator in the commit tool removed, replaced by a
Ctrl-Enter generic accelerator that is common to many dialogs.

Shell extension configuration removed from Mercurial.ini.  However they
are editable in the taskbar options dialog and changes made there take
effect immediately.

There is no supported method in 0.8 for de-registering the shell
extension without uninstalling THG.  You can globally disable the
overlays via it's configurable option, but the context menu is always
present.

Merge and unmerge were removed from the shell context menu.  You must
use the changelog tool to perform merges.

The changelog tool does not show all file diffs in a changeset right
away.  It only shows the first file's diffs.  To see all diffs at once,
the user must click 'All Files' at the top of the file list.

Changelog, commit, status, etc all obey a maximum file size for showing
diffs (default is 1MB).  Files above this size will not be diffed for
performance reasons (obviously you can still commit them).  This max
diff limit is configurable per-repository via the settings dialog.

The default dbl-click action in the Changelog tool is now visual diff.
In previous releases it was 'Display Change'.

Commit, status, shelve no longer show all diffs at once.  They only show
diffs for the selected file.  This change was made for performance
reasons.

The 'show diffs' button was removed from commit, status, shelve.

hgtk forks a separate process for GUI commands, freeing up the CLI.
HGTK_NOFORK environment variable and the --nofork argument disable the
forking behavior.  This will be user configurable in 0.9.

== Installer / Source Changes ==

The hgtk script has been moved from contrb/ into the project root.

The hgproc script and batch file have been removed.

The tortoise python package has been removed.

The thgutil package has been added.

The tracelog application has been removed, since THG no longer uses
win32traceutil.  Dbgview from sysinternals can be used to debug the new
shell extension.

The forest and qct extensions are no longer bundled.  Forest is being
replaced by a core Mercurial feature (subrepo) in hg-1.3, and qct has
not been included in THG since 0.6.  Both extensions can still be used
with THG 0.8, you must download them and then specify their full path in
your user Mercurial.ini file.

We no longer bundle extra GTK themes.  We only ship MS-Windows since it
now works correctly on all the platforms we're interested in.

We no longer bundle msvcp71.dll and msvcr.dll

We no longer bundle Putty.exe and Puttygen.exe, but Pageant is still
included.

We now bundle win32 and x64 versions of TortoiseOverlays.


= Release 0.7 March 1, 2009 =

Bug fixes since 0.7:

* thgutil: UNC paths should be filtered by 'localdisks' config
* serve: direct web browser at loopback address
* shlib: moved app data to %APPDATA%\TortoiseHg on Windows
* thgconfig: UTF-8 fixes
* thgconfig: show description of selected item
* thgconfig: move 'bottom diffs' to tortoisehg page
* datamine: fix markup problem in status bar
* sync: allow bundles without .hg extension
* sync: handle non-ascii paths and aliases
* status: prevent traceback caused by toggling rename diffs
* update: fix update to rev 0 from changelog viewer
* hgtK: follow 'hg version' convention for 'hgtk version'

New features and improvements in 0.7:

  * Status window now supports shelving of selected changes.
    Unknown files are now displayed by default, hg status convention.

  * Commit window now supports commit of selected changes (record-style)
    or shelving of selected changes.
    Modified, Added, and Removed files are preselected for commit.
    Added a ctrl-o key accelerator for initiating a commit.

    Improved support for merge (two parent) commits.

  * Qct has been unbundled and must be downloaded separately.  We
    strongly suggest you use the internal tool instead, as it has better
    change selection support than Qct and it is much better integrated
    into TortoiseHg.

    TortoiseHg will always use the internal commit tool by default,
    unless the user selects Qct as the prefered *external* commit tool.

Fixes in Mercurial since 0.3:

  * qimport fixed on Windows
  * new built-in filemerge system replaces hgmerge patches
  * many fixes for keyword extension
  * new -U (context lines) argument for diff and qdiff commands

New features in 0.3

  * Major improvements to changelog browser.  It is now good enough to
    deprecate both hgk and hgview.  Neither are bundled with the 0.3
    binary installer, but both can be added by the user if they wish.
    Support for external revision log viewers will be dropped in 0.4.

  * The new changelog browser supports filtering by file pattern,
    keywords, dates, and branches.  It is capable of graphing both the
    repository changelog and individual filelogs.  Changeset coloring by
    author is optional (tortoisehg.authorcolor).  All changeset graphing
    is done incrementally in batches (tortoisehg.graphlimit: 500)

  * New DataMine application for searching history (hg grep) and
    inspecting file histories (hg annotate).  This new application is
    tabbed to facilitate debugging sessions where search results and
    annotations can be grouped together for easy cross-reference.

  * New changeset browser, supports multiple parents intrinsically and
    supports a number of file-revision features (view at revision, save
    at revision, annotate at revision, revert to revision, etc).  The
    new changeset browser is also integrated into the changelog browser.

  * Standardized window layouts.  Close buttons have been moved to the
    toolbar.  Dialogs that use progress bars now use a standard status
    bar/progress bar widget.  Tooltips have been added.

  * Hgtk wrapper application for launching TortoiseHg dialogs from the
    command line

  * Support for an external visual editor: tortoisehg.editor.  Takes
    precedence over ui.editor when viewing files with TortoiseHg

  * Performance improvements in Mercurial itself (cset 0973501e5f4a)

  * New installer bitmap from Peer Sommerlund

  * Misc: The Synchronize dialog has been improved.  The Web Serve
    dialog no longer requires a subprocess to run the web server.  The
    configuration dialog has a number of bug fixes for the paths tab,
    and now has separators in the drop-down boxes for the varying value
    types (current, suggested, history). Http authentication has been
    fixed.  The hg integration library has seen major cleanups.

Bug Fixes in 0.3:

  * [ 1863086 ] "Revision Graph" fail on UNC path
    Fixed by removing hgk from base install.  Integrated log viewer
    is UNC path safe.
  * [ 1851395 ] Total Commander problem
  * [ 1882074 ] global name 'p' is not defined
  * [ 1854443 ] View changelog fails

New features in 0.2

  * Gtools has been integrated into TortoiseHg proper. It is no longer
    bundled as a Mercurial extension. The graphlog extension is now enabled
    again by default (only usable from the CLI, however).

  * Context menu icons, application window icons. The context menu has been
    simplified.

  * The changelog browser has a number of new features (filters and context
    menu options). The tag browser and changelog tagging features have been
    merged into this tool.

  * Hgview is now the default history viewer, hgk is being deprecated.

  * An email dialog for interfacing with the patchbomb extension. It can be
    reached from the synchronize dialog and from the changelog browser.

  * A new configuration tool (replacing hg-config dialogs) that allows you
    to configure TortoiseHg and Mercurial.

  * Most dialogs now use HgThread and GtkUI to run hg commands. These
    classes run the command in a background thread and provide GUI prompts
    for when user interaction is necessary (http web auth, etc). For some
    commands, it also provides a progress bar.

  * A preview of the new Mercurial merge back end. The python hgmerge.py
    script is being integrated into Mercurial, and this installer has a
    preview of how that will work. You need to unset any ui.merge in your
    Mercurial.ini file in order for it to work properly. If you don't
    configure anything it will use simplemerge to automatically perform
    merges. If conflicts are found it falls back to kdiff3 to resolve
    them interactively.

  * Slight improvement on speed of overlay icons display.

  * A new 'about' dialog.

Bugs fixed in 0.2

  * [SF Bug #1851395] Overlay icons and context menus are no longer
    restricted to MS-Explorer. So other file managers, such as Total
    Commander, should be supported.

  * [SF Bug #1844722] Users can now create repositories inside repository
     via the context menu.
