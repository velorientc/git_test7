** Please do not run setup.py **

On Linux, the suggested methods for using TortoiseHg are to either
install a package built for your distribution, or run directly out of a
cloned repository.  For details, see:

http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/wiki/download

http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/wiki/hgtk

http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/wiki/nautilus


On Windows, we prefer you use the more recent stable release, which
can always be found at http://tortoisehg.org


If you ran setup.py and are now having troubles with icons, you have two
choices:

1) Find the tortoisehg/util/config.py file that was installed and
manually edit it to fixup the paths.

2) Delete the installation and use one of the preferred install methods.
